# Ramen Ho!

Have you ever rolled up to your favorite ramen shop only to discover that there's a huge crowd already waiting to get seated? You don't have time to wait! Well, maybe there's a way to avoid those lines. Enter 'Ramen Ho'!

Ramen Ho! is two apps - a mobile app that informs the ramen-hungry customer **which ramen shops have the SHORTEST wait times**, and a tablet app that allows ramen shop proprietors to make sure they're seating their customers efficiently and in order. By **broadcasting live waittimes** to customers on the hunt, Ramen Ho! helps the ramen-eater spend less time driving around and more time eating those delicious noodles, and it allows ramen shops to make sure they've always got customers on the hook!
